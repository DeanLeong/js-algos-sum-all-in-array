## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Sum All In Array"

### Objectives

- Create a function that adds all numbers of a provided array (`arr`), accounting for non-integer values in `arr`.
- The output should return an integer.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes

Remember your data types? If the element is an integer (`8`), it should be added. If the element is a **string** with a number value (`"8"`), it should be added. If the element is not a number, or if it is a string with a non-number value, it should be ignored.
